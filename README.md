# nand2tetris

This is a repository containing all of the work done for the Nand2Tetris course.

Here is what is each folder:

- 1/ Implementation of logic gates, multiplexers, and demultiplexers using NAND gates.
- 2/ Implementation of the half adder, full adder, incrementer, and ALU.
- 3/ Implementation of the bit, register, program counter, and RAM. Uses D flip flops for sequential circuits.
- 4/ Two hack assembly programs.
- 5/ Implementation of the CPU, memory, and the hack computer.
- 6/ The hack assembler, written in C.
